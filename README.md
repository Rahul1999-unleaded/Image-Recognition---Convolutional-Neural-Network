# Image-Recognition->Convolutional-Neural-Network

Todayâ€™s image recognition applies deep learning techniques in the
field of computer vision. The most popular algorithms for deep
learning for computer vision are called Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN). CNNs are based on an architecture designed to
process and understand the data present in high-resolution images.


CNNs are inspired by the design of the human brain, in which the
neurons interpret the visual stimuli in the visual cortex. This part of
the cortex consists of a field composed of restricted regions.
Consumers often abandon a site because the search result displays
irrelevant products. We are providing solutions that contextualize
and improve search results of online shoppers. We will build models
to train the algorithm to understand any concept, including logos and
non-photographic images.
The goal is to make the search more visually and consumer-centric as
possible.

# Purpose:-
In this project we introduced an approach of different Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) designs concerning their performance in
various undertakings of fashion image classification. The main

purpose is to provide a better and significant approach for E-
Commerce business. This will provide the consumers a superior a

more refine approach for online shopping. In online shopping,
product search is a key component. When a user is online to buy a
particular product, in most of the cases, he finds it by entering
product related information on search engine like amazon or flipkart.
These search engines allow users to search based on a criterion like
keywords, categories, etc. This can be solved using image
recognition.The experiments indicated that the large amount and
high quality of provided fashion images, pre-trained and fine-tuned
models perform in the best possible way to help the consumer in
refining the search on the collection. However, they do not provide
any search functionality based on images.

# Results:-
As the model trains, the loss and accuracy metrics are
displayed. This model reaches an accuracy of about
0.9296 (or 92.96%%) and a train loss of 0.1733 on the
training data.
The accuracy on the test dataset is 92.61% which is a
little less than the accuracy on the training dataset.
This gap between training accuracy and test accuracy
is an example of overfitting. Overfitting is when a
machine learning model performs worse on new data
than on their training data.The problem with
overfitting, is that the more specialized the model
becomes to training data, the less well it is able to
generalize to new data, resulting in an increase in
generalization error. This increase in generalization
error can be measured by the performance of the
model on the validation dataset. However, this does
not affect the predictions much as it is very minimal
The graphs which have been plotted almost exactly
stay true to what the model predicts.

The y-axis of the top graph represents loss and the y-
axis represents epoch.

Similarly, the y-axis of the top graph represents the
accuracy and the x-axis represents epoch
